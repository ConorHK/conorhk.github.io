      things that interest me
    </h2>
    <p>
      I post what i'm working on on <a href=
      "https://github.com/conorhk">my github</a>.
      I want to move to a FOSS platform over Microsoft's closed source product though, so this will change to Sourcehut or some other alternative soon when I get a chance to migrate.

    <h4>
      some of my projects i think are cool:
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>My homelab! Its currently backed up to private block storeage as I haven't fully nixified the setup yet. I run roughly 30 microservices (such as <a href="https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/">paperless-ngx</a>, <a href="https://immich.app/">immich</a>, a MQTT based location tracker, HomeAssistant, Headscale mesh network, reverse proxy etc). Everything is backed up daily to regionalized datacenters from different providers with snapshots for redundancy (and fun). I use it as a vehicle to make life more convienent while also learning about networking, system design etc. My next project here is to move everything to NixOS and <a href="https://grahamc.com/blog/erase-your-darlings/">erase my darlings</a> as the idea of Opt-In for state permanence by default is a cool concept to me.</li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/ConorHK/dots">my arch dotfiles</a>
	lot of time spent here! Although now moreso I'm spending my time in my <a href="https://github.com/ConorHK/dots">ndots (nix dots)</a>. Nix is cool, hermetic build systems are cool, fully declaritive state is cool. Compute as cattle not pets.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/ConorHK/vimrc">my neovim config</a>, almost exclusively written in lua. I use nvim for pretty much everything. Can be installed via nixCats now!
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/ConorHK/kyria">kyria split ergo
        keyboard qmk firmware</a>, with some cool custom features such as capsword, x-case, and WPM graphs. Written in C.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/ConorHK/scripts">My scripts</a>, which I use a personal fork of Ianthehenry's script-directory tool for mapping and organization. Learned a lot about ZSH completion engine from playing here.
      </li>
      <li>Theres a blog somewhere in the index of this site. It was just filler content for a static site generation tool I was writing from my phone while backpacking. The 22 hour bus rides needed to be filled, and the blog is the product of that. I'm not going to link it and instead make it a fun little puzzle to find. Encode the link in the favicon image or something maybe.</li>
      <li> I'm slowly in the process of building a video game streaming service out of my gaming PC. So far I have the WakeOnLAN-from-anywhere working, launching and playing parts sorted out. I have not worked out how to handle alternative screen resolutions as Wayland doesn't riverWM doesn't have any virtual monitor functionality and I don't have the time to hack on wlRoots to implement it. So right now if I want to play Civ from my couch my monitors turn on too.</li>
