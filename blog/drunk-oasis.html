<h1>Living in the desert</h1>
<p>I'm shitting on the toilet at 2:30am and need to get up at 6:40. Just carried the tour guide to her hotel room. I feel like im in trouble.</p>
<p>No script updates as far as the blog is concerned. I had some ideas regarding hyperlinks and automated git pushes but I havent bothered with implementation yet. My head is spinning a bit. Tour to some islands tomorrow so if im hungover im gonna hate life. Ah well. Tax evasion is the route forward im thinking, otherwise life will be much more difficult.</p>
