<h1>High altitude Huaraz</h1>
<p>I am currently sweltering in a homely restaurant outside Huaraz, Peru (the Switzerland of South America). I've been in high altitudes before but the effect of it here feels quite intense. I think its around 3100m. Lethargic and light is tthe best way to summarise it. </p>
<p>The benefits of high altitude living appeal to me, youd become a super hero when back at sea level.</p>
<p>We're headed to an hour hike a couple hous drive away to see some glacier called Pastrorui according to Elmer. I've never seen a glacier so I'm pretty buzzed. </p>
<p>Anyway this post is just a life snapshot, and proof of concept for my blog script. It's in its infant stages, at the moment it just reads in a header and footer and converts markdown to html. I want it to index posts with titles and dates, and work agnostic of directory position. Stuff like tab titles should be incremented properly too. Still, I wrote it on a 22 hour bus to Mancora on Termux on my phone. The current condition is good enough, all things given.</p>
<p>I'm gonna include the code snippet below just to see how python-markdown handles code snippets more than anything. Meta-snippet haha.</p>
<p>```</p>
<h1>!/usr/bin/env python3</h1>
<p>import markdown
import sys</p>
<p>input_file = sys.argv[1]
filename = input_file.split(".")[0].split("/")[-1]
output_file = f"../conorhk.github.io/blog/{filename}.html"
print(output_file)</p>
<p>with open(input_file, 'r') as f:
    text = f.read()
    html = markdown.markdown(text)</p>
<p>def write_with_headers(output_file):
    with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
        with open("resources/header.html", "r") as header:
            for line in header:
                f.write(line)
        f.write(html)
        with open("resources/footer.html", "r") as footer:
            for line in footer:
                f.write(line)</p>
<p>write_with_headers(output_file)
```</p>
