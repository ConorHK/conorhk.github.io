<h1>yet another bus</h1>
<p>In the last two weeks i've been on a bus an average of 4.2 hours a day. My arse is at levels above any regular human on account of the turmoil it has endured. I'm writing this 6hrs into the bus from Huaraz to Lima. This leg of my trip is ending and another is starting tomorrow. Hopefully it'll be as much craic.</p>
<p>This bus is mental. I dont know if its because its a day bus and I've watched most of the road or if its just this bus. Either way, mental. Swerving potholes more often than not and 10 minutes ago we nearly killed a tuktuk. I think we're nearing the end soon so hopefully we'll make it unscathed.</p>
<p>I wrote the index logic today. You can find it at <a href="https://conorknowles.com/blogposts.html">blogposts</a> (lets see if that link works). Its very messy, and I havent sorted code snippet formatting yet, as per the last post, so I wont post it here. It'll be on github at some point. A big barrier for phone travel blogging has been passed though.</p>
